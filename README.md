### Expedition Update
Since update 3.3(namely Expedition), Hello Games gives us all Travellers a chance to explorer the Universe together.
Expedition is a community-driven time-limited event which has multiple phases and sub-missions for us to complete and explore the secret of Universe.
We have gone on 3 expeditions so far, new expeditions are coming on the way.

------------

### Background
Because it is community-driven and time-limited events, we will not be able to revisit the past expeditions due to the nature of events without a trick.


------------

### Pros & Cons

##### Pros

- You can play Expedition at any time you want on your save, with no pressure on your mind as long as you play the save in completely offline and Date set to permitted time range.
- No obstructed by other players buildings, no laggy spikes because of the Multiplayer.

##### Cons

- You have to repeat all the steps each time you load your Expedition save.
- You have to go completely offline.
- No building obstruction is also backfiring: while in Online Multiplayer, other players' buildings may give you better advantages for a head-start, while in offline, you have to do it on your own( it is like you are playing a normal save)

------------

### Steps 

#### What do you need?

- For the people who cannot afford to finish all milestones before the deadline, you need your intact Expedition save game.
- For the people who comes late to the expedition, who has their save converted, you need a spare save slot.
